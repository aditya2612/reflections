What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

->we can't see any commit,initially there are zero commit 
->on using git status there is untracked version of files
->git init creates .git file which is a hidden file
-> we need because it helps to create project and maintain the files accordingly , and make the changes.

2) How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

yes by add file to staging area 
then run diff --staged command so see final file
then run git commit command , after your file is being commited

3)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

it helps if we want to do any experimental changes , it will help to know the changes what you have made. if you dont like your changes you can move to master directory , or else continue in the same  directory

4)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

branch helps me to identify what changes have been done in what branch. with making of branch i am able to understand which id is part of which branch & which are parents of that particular id.


5)What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

some files were added to both of them according to conflicting mechanism


6) What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
